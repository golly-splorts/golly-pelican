# About Golly

## What is Conway's Game of Life?

Life is a cellular automaton that evolves deterministically from an initial state.
Life takes place on a grid, and each cell is designated as either alive or dead.
The rules of the game are as follows:

* A living cell with fewer than two live neighbors will die, as if through underpopulation.
* A living cell with two or three live neighbors will continue living in the next generation.
* A cell with more than three live neighbors will die, as if by overpopulation.
* A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

[LifeWiki](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Main_Page) has a wealth of information about different
patterns, variations on the Game of Life rules, and notable news and historical information about
the Game of Life.

## Who was John Conway?

John Conway was a distinguished mathematician who made many contributions to mathematics,
including the invention of the Game of Life. A nomination of Conway to become a Fellow of
the Royal Society described him as "A versatile mathematician who combines a deep combinatorial
insight with algebraic virtuosity, particularly in the construction and manipulation of
'off-beat' algebraic structures which illuminate a wide variety of problems in completely
unexpected ways."

John Conway passed away on 11 April 2020. Although he would probably
[roll his eyes at us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8kUJL04ELA),
we dedicate golly to the memory of John Conway.

Here is [an excellent video summarizing John Conway's career](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsecAiJDI8s)
from [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A).

## What is golly? How is golly different from the Game of Life?

Golly is a modified version of the Game of Life in which live cells have colors,
and cells that become alive take on the color of the majority of their parents.

More of the rules specific to Golly can be found on the [Rules](rules.md) page.

Teams achieve a win by being the tam with the most live cells on the grid when the 
simulation reaches a steady state (also see [Rules](rules.md)).

Golly was wholly inspired by blaseball. It is classified as a splort. If those words
do not mean anything to you, please continue on to the next question.

## What is blaseball? What is a splort?

Blaseball is an internet splort that was born in July 2020.
You can check out [this excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5t8DwnDE1k)
that explains what blaseball is, or check out
[this blaseball primer](https://catacalypto.substack.com/p/i-am-all-love-blaseball-and-so-can)
by Cat Manning, written way back in Season 4 (it has aged well).

(The creators of Golly, as well as the Golly Commissioner, are all Hellmouth Sunbeams fans.)

A splort is defined as a competition between teams where the game is random and there is no strategy.
Splorts teams have no means to control the entirely-random outcome.

Splorts are a reflection of the random and absurd nature of the universe and our existence.
They can help us learn to embrace whatever happens, build communities, create art, make new
friends, and have fun.

## Who is the commissioner of golly?

Rubrix Helicopter is the Golly Commissioner.

Rubrix Helicopter is a Hellmouth Community College instructor who, 40 years ago,
froze themselves in an experimental cryogenic chamber and left detailed instructions
to be awakend from the cryogenic state after 100 years.

Instead, the Metablaseball Research Laboratory at Hellmouth Community College decided
to awaken Rubrix Helicopter and make them the Golly Commissioner.
This served to free up storage space occupied by the crogenic chamber, and significantly
reduced HCC's electrical bill, which was key to securing support for golly from
HCC administrators.

## What is the Metablaseball Research Laboratory (MeRL)?

The [Metablaseball Research Laboratory (MeRL)](https://ch4zm.github.io/metablaseball)
is a research laboratory at Hellmouth Community College. MeRL researches ways of 
creating absurd, simulated versions of blaseball, modifying or adding rules, and 
creating rosters of fictional players and filling in their backstories. MeRL then
simulates these simple blaseball universes using specialized mechanical devices.

Research at MeRL doesn't stop at blaseball - MeRL applies the techniques
of metablaseball to other splorts. In fact, this is exactly what led to the
birth of the splort of golly.

## What is Hellmouth Community College (HCC)?

Hellmouth Community College is the premier educational institution in Hellmouth,
home of the Hellmouth Sunbeams.

Enrollment at HCC is open to all Hellmouth residents, and tuition is always free.

The Hellmouth Community College mascot is the
[Welsh Dragons](https://twitter.com/ch4zm_of_hell/status/1317931011284652035).
